[Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020)

Trying to complete the calendar using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). I've only played around with 
Rust a handful of times, so this code will probably be non-idiomatic and generally non-optimal. I spend most of my days writing
Python, so this is just a fun exercise for the end of the year.
